# Payment Reconciliation - Hyperledger Composer

This project is for Health Insurance payer to reconcile the status of the payments (Checks, EFT's) with respective Banks.

Payer creates checks, EFTs for the healthcare providers(Doctors) who have contract with them. They send the payment details to Bank and reconcile them once the provider receives the payments.

The reconciliation happens overnight through batch processing and the updates are not transparent.

Payer organization creates a blockchain network and invites all the banks to join them so the updates can be put into shared ledger and instant. Providers also can be given access to the Blockchain application so there will be great level of transparency on the status of the payment and can be tracked easily.
